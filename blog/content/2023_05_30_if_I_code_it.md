# If I can code it, I understand it

So as I decided to look for learning something new, I figured I haven't looked at UI land in a while 
`<cat what they doign meme>`.
Svelte is the new kid.
What do I build.
I want a offline app to calculate and save mortgage.
- pwa way to go.
- learn to calcualte constant rent payment. Wish I took econ 101. (I signed up now!).
